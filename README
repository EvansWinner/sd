sd
==

[Important: commands that don't work: $, ", and who knows what else]

sd (for "slide deck") is a hyper-minimal presentation program strictly
for terminal use. It requires env, bash, sed, wc, find, and cat.

sd reads plain text files from a given directory and presents them (shows
them) in ASCII sort order.

To install:

 1. Make sure sd is executable. Do something like --

      $ chmod u+x sd

 2. Copy sd to somewhere in your path. You don't want to have it in the same
    directory as the files for your presentation, because if you do, it will
    treat sd itself as one of the slides.

 3. Type --
 
      $ sd -h

    at the command line to get all the documentation.

 4. Profit
  

Important notes:

 1. It is feature-complete. There will be no Markdown support, additional
    commands, etc.

 2. I might give it a bang (!) command to run command line commands like
    ed(1) has, but honestly, you can just do C-z to suspend it and do what-
    ever you like, so I don't think I will. 

 3. I would have preferred to write it in pure POSIX shell, but I'm not
    smart enough to figure out how to do arrays in POSIX shell.

 4. There is no number 4. That's it.


Examples:

Ok, I said there was a help page, but here's an example use to make it
easier:

  $ sd -t 10 -l 25 -b "My Title | J. Random Hacker | 2025-02-19" -d testExample

This will pad every slide ten lines down, and 25 characters to the left. It
will include a header or "b" for "banner" at the top of every slide, and will
look for its slides in the "testExample" directory.

Once sd is running, try typing h (and enter) to get a help page. Yes, the same
help page.

Another yak, shaved.
